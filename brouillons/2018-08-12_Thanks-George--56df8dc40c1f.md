Thanks George,

What I mean about the Huawei version is that when I tried it with the mate 10 the desktop interface did not look so production ready. E.g. you could not launch Gmail, you had to wait for a notification to pop then stick the icon to the bottom of the screen…

The screen I use is a Magedok 11.6 USB-C. I also tried the gechic ones, but they’re way more expensive. It’s frustrating to be using the HDMI port of the screen to get Dex : the USB-C port could suffice if Samsung decided so. The only problem with that screen is that the touch works but not the multitouch : it makes the screen crash. I guess the cheap Dex adapter I own doesn’t give it enough juice for brightness > 50 + multitouch. It works at a low brightness.
